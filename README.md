# TCP-UDP-Client-and-Server
This repository contains two client/server programs that I wrote for my CS3873 Computer Networks class. Everything was written in C.

This repo contains two sets of clients and servers. Each set was implemented with a different protocol, one being UDP and the other being TCP.
Additionally, the TCP server utilizes the "pthread" header to allow for multithreading. Each new connection established with the TCP
server is run on a new thread. While this was classwork, I wanted to allow for anyone that needed help with C sockets, threads, and network calls
to have a reference. I also wanted to allow feedback on my C programming, as I am always trying to get better. Any feedback is appreciated.

##### Details on compilation, along with further descriptions for each project are provided in their respective folders.
